## 🚀 About Us
We are **WilSonic Boom**, FTC Team **33001** from **Wilson’s School, London**.  
We compete in the **FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC)**—a global robotics competition where students design, build, and program robots to solve advanced engineering challenges.

Our team of **15 dedicated students (ages 14–17)** focuses on innovation, technical excellence, and STEM outreach. After reaching the UK **Grand Final as rookies**, we are aiming even higher this season.

## 🎮 2025–26 Season: DECODE
This year’s game, **DECODE**, is played on a 12 ft × 12 ft field with 36 artefacts (24 purple + 12 green).  
Teams must classify and score artefacts based on a randomly selected **motif** (a 3-artefact code with 2 purple + 1 green).  
Robots must intake, sort, and score efficiently while navigating classifier gates, field constraints, and alliance strategies.

This repository documents our engineering journey through DECODE, including CAD, programming, testing, and match preparation.
